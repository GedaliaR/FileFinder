# FileFinder

A homework assignment to find a file on the C: drive with a given file name.

I took three different approaches to solve this problem from simple to complex, and I spelled out the cost tradeoffs of each solution in the class-level Javadoc of each one.

In the most complex solution that I came up with, I used an external library called JGraphT to graph the file directory.
