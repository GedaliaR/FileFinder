# FileFinder

A homework assignment to find a file on the C: drive with a given file name. The specs of the assignment was to take a file name and a root directory as Strings, and return the found file's path as a List.

I took three different approaches to solve this problem from simple to complex, and I spelled out the cost tradeoffs of each solution in the class-level Javadoc of each one.

In the most complex solution that I came up with, I used an external library called JGraphT to graph the file directory.
